# Location Offers App

Android app that utilises location data and local push notifications to inform a user of when they are near a business that offers rewards associated with their account e.g. free coffee from Pret for rewards card holders.

## Getting Started

* Android Studio
* An emulator from Android Studio
	* See: Android Studio -> Configure -> AVD Manager
* NPM
* NodeJS (includes NPM)

## Up and Running

First open the emulator you configured through Android Studio, then follow the steps below.

1. Install project dependencies with the following command: `npm install`
2. Start the bundler with `npm start`
3. Run the Android version of our app with: `npm run android`
4. (Optional) Configure your editor to use Prettier stored in the project's node_modules folder

This should load the app into the emulator. We can edit the app by modify code and saving, once saved the bundler will pick up on the changes and update the app with our changes.
